Hey there! 
I built this app, It's a simple, mobile-friendly web app that lets you log in, check a dashboard, top up an account, and view your transaction history.

Tech I Used üõ†Ô∏è
I put this together using a modern tech stack:

React with TypeScript for the core of the app.

Vite for a super-fast development experience.

Tailwind CSS for all the styling.

React Router to handle page navigation.

Context API to manage the user's state after they log in.

Getting it Running Locally
